#Tests
These tests are more like utilities I used to test my server, there is no one cannonical test.
##Installing dependencies

* Node.js
* CoffeeScript compiler
* memjs

Once node and npm are installed, you should be able to run `npm install` to fetch dependencies listed in package.json.  Then you can run each utility against the built server: `coffee <test file>`.

[I fixed a bug in the client lib I'm using](https://github.com/alevy/memjs/pull/58).
